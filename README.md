# `cargo-like-utils`

A collection of utilities to emulate `cargo`'s behaviour and output style
in other CLIs.  
It is mostly built out of extracted code from `cargo` itself, although
there is no guarantee that the code will be kept up to date with upstream
nor that it replicates `cargo`'s behavior exactly.

It's a utility crate relied upon in [Pavex](https://pavex.dev) and
[`cargo-px`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-px).
